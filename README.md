# Emotion-Detection

This project aims to classify the emotion on a personâ€™s face into 
one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural 
networks.

This emotion detector was built using Keras and 
Tensorflow library.
Used Adam and RMSprop optimizer to increase the 
accuracy of the model

Data was used from Kaggle which is a freely available platform for data scientists.
